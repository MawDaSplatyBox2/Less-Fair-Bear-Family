# Less-Fair-Bear-Family
This add-on mod for the [Bear Family](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/16197) rebalances the prices at Gunnar's shop and the Bears' vending machine, making things more expensive by default and providing config options to change the price scaling. Sell values have been adjusted so that items can't be easily resold for a profit.

## Config
Gunnar's Generosity - Worried about committing the cardinal sin of erasing Gunnar's gorgeous generous prices? Use this config to make prices more Gunnar-like 😇, or take the other path and make the shop even more expensive 👿.
<br>Year One Generosity - A different generosity level can be set for the first year on the farm. Gunnar can optionally give more affordable prices to fresh blood, or make the shop unaffordable for the whole year.
<br>Additional Price Settings - Customise the pricing for Adventure Caches, more expensive Potions and the Ferseken Peach Sapling.
<br>Bramble Berry Edibility - Change how much energy and health bramble berries restore.
<br>Pumpkin & Peach Cola - Change the price and value of joja cola bought from the Bears' vending machine.
<br>Bonus - Feeling lucky? Bring the power of 7 to the Remedy All's luck and price.
